# Image Resizer

A simple Python script to resize images using the Pillow (PIL) library.

## Overview

This script opens an image file (`cat.png` by default), resizes it to the specified width and height, and saves the resized image as a new file. 

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aastik7/image-resizer-py.git
   cd image-resizer-py
   python resize_image.py


Add any image in the repo directory and replace "cat.png" in line 5 to your given image file name.

You will be prompted to enter the desired width and height.

Note: You can replace cat.png with any picture in the root directory to resize a different image.

Requirements
Python (version 3.x recommended)
Pillow library (pip install Pillow)
